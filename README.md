# Graph-Project
This is a project I did in school that demonstrates my creation and use of graphs using an 
adjacency list, priority queue, and Dijkstra's algorithm. 
The project contains JUnit test classes, a Black Box testing document, and relevant javadoc. 
There is a simple command line UI, and the project is written in Java using OO concepts and the mvc design pattern.
